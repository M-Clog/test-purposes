test-purposes
=============

Dummy repo to learn basic commands

Geochem, stable isotopes, mantle heterogeneities, ridge processes, natural gas generation, ethane isotopic characteristics

I'm currently stressing about finding a job for next year, finishing 3 papers for publication, preparing a 1h talk due in 2 weeks. Also, I have too many heavy books that will not fit in my luggage.

In this branch, I am also adding some sweating and ranting.

Les tests de branches par git marchent bien, la retention de MdP aussi. Test ici depuis Win8 pour les fins de ligne.

Genre comme ca.
